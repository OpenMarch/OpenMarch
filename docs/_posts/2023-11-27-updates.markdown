This is OpenMarch's first public update! Not much to see here besides basic features.
- Moving marchers
- Changing pages
- Displaying coordinates by steps
  - i.e. 2 steps outside 50 S1, 3.75 steps in front of front has
- Zooming in/out and navigating the field canvas

Don't take this for granted. This took me months to figure out!
