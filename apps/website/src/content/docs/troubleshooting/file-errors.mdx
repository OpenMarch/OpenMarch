<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>
    ### Windows
    #### Using the File Explorer

    <Steps>

    1. Locate the file in Windows File Explorer.
    2. Right-click on the file and select Properties from the context menu
    3. In the Properties window, go to the Security tab
    4. Under "Group or user names," select your user account or the group you belong to
    5. In the "Permissions for [Your Username]" box below, check the "Allow" column for Read and Write permissions. A checkmark indicates you have the permission
    6. If "Read" or "Write" is not checked, or if "Deny" is checked, you do not have that specific permission. Contact your system administrator for more information

    </Steps>

  <summary>Mac</summary>

    ### Mac
    #### Using Finder
    ##### Assign permissions to users and groups
    <Steps>

    1. On your Mac, select a disk, folder, or file, then choose File > Get Info.
    2. If the information in Sharing & Permissions isn’t visible, click the arrow. (You may need to scroll down.)
    3. Click the lock to unlock permission settings.
    4. Select a user or group in the Name column, click the pop-up menu, then choose a privilege setting.
        - Read & Write: Allows a user to open the item and change it.
        - Read only: Allows a user to open the item, but not change its contents.
        - Write only (Drop Box): Makes a folder into a drop box. Users can copy items to the drop box, but can’t open it. Only the owner of the drop box can open it.
        - No Access: Blocks all access to the item.
    </Steps>

    You can undo any changes to privilege settings for a user or group in the Sharing & Permissions section since opening the Info window. Before closing the Info window, click the Action pop-up menu at the bottom of the window, then choose “Revert changes.”

## File Not Found Error

If you see an error similar to `The file does not exist at this location` this is likely due to trying
to open a recent file that has since moved or been renamed. Please review the following steps:

<Steps>

1. Open the source folder of the `.dots` file.
2. Verify the `.dots` file exists in that folder and has not been renamed.
3. If the `.dots` file was moved or renamed, use the `Open File` menu item in OpenMarch to open the
   moved / renamed file. Click the `X` button on the Recent Files section to remove the outdated file.

</Steps>

If you were not using the Recent Files section and you received this error, please
