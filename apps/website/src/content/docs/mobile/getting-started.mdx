**OpenMarch -** **_On the Move_** is a mobile companion app that allows you to instantly distribute your show to performers' mobile devices.

## How it works

When you upload shows to **OpenMarch -** **_On the Move_**, they are organized by **Ensembles** and **Productions**.

- **Ensemble** - one group for one season. For example:
  - `South River High School Marching Band - 2026`
  - `Maroon Wave Winterguard - 2027`
  - `The Virginia Anthem Drum and Bugle Corps - 2027`
- **Production** - a movement, show, or song that an **Ensemble** performs. For example:
  - `Movement 1 - Fanfare`
  - `Closer tag`
  - `Pregame`
  - `Part 2 - Ballad`

Each **Ensemble** can have one or many **Productions** based on how you would like to structure and distribute your show.
