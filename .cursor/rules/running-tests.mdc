# Running tests

## Vitest

- When testing an individual test, always "cd" into the folder of the monorepo project and run the test from there.
- Run the test file using "pnpm exec vitest {args}"

E.g. for a test in the desktop app

```bash
cd apps/desktop && pnpm exec vitest path/to/the/test-file.test.ts
```
