# Timeline UI

The spec (`spec.md`) deliberately leaves out the editor UI (§14). This file is
the UI's source of truth: it adopts the timeline built on the `0.2` branch as
the reference presentation, and maps it onto the spec's model. Phase 8 builds
from it. The spec still wins on the model; this file decides presentation.

- Reference: `origin/0.2` at `568056aa`, in
  `apps/desktop/src/components/timeline/` (`Timeline.tsx`, `TimelineVariants.tsx`,
  `TimelinePrimitives.tsx`, `TimelineViewModel.ts`, `TimelineGeometry.ts`,
  `TimelineCanvas.tsx`, `TimelineStoryFixtures.ts`, `Timeline.stories.tsx`).
- Run the stories to see it: they cover the expanded and collapsed densities,
  page and track selection, range selection with Create Track, inactive spans
  and a 512-beat show.
- Status: proposed until P8.0 confirms it.

## What the reference UI is

- A page ruler (page buttons, measure labels, rehearsal marks), a beat grid, a
  waveform lane, a draggable playback cursor, a transport, and zoom.
- Tracks drawn as one clip each, packed into rows automatically. Two densities:
  expanded (22 px rows) and collapsed (5 px micro-pills).
- Selection: a page, a track or a free range, shown as one overlay with
  draggable start and end flags and an "N counts" badge. **Create Track**
  appears for a range when a target is selected.
- Moving a clip snaps to whole beats and commits once, on pointer-up.
- Units are beat indexes with half-open `[start, end)` ranges, the same as
  spec §7 and ADR 0001.

## Decisions

- **UI-1: dashed "inactive" spans mean "stolen".** Inside a clip, a span is
  inactive where the target has an assignment in that timeline but a
  higher-layer assignment wins (spec R-2), or where the target has no
  assignment in that timeline. This is derived from the resolver; nothing
  extra is stored. (0.2's draft `transition_assignment.is_active` column is not
  adopted.)
- **UI-2: timelines start and end on any beat.** The spec allows motion to begin
  mid-page, which breakaways need (golden vector G2 steals at beat 8 of a
  16-beat move). The UI snaps to page lines by default as an aid, and a
  modifier key turns snapping off. The reference validator's page-boundary
  rule is removed when the components are ported.

## Mapping the spec onto the view model

The reference `TimelineViewModel` becomes a derived view: an adapter builds it
from the stored tables and the resolver, and nothing in it is stored.

| View model                                   | Built from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beatCount`, `pages`, `measures`             | beats, pages and measures, as today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Marcher track                                | one per spec timeline in which the marcher has an assignment. Clip range: the marcher's first assignment start to last assignment end in that timeline                                                                                                                     |
| Marcher track `legs`                         | the marcher's resolver spans (R-2) inside the clip: a hold span is `hold`; any other span is `move`                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Marcher track `activitySpans`                | active where the marcher's winning span belongs to an assignment in this timeline; inactive otherwise (UI-1)                                                                                                                                                               |
| Shape track                                  | one per spec timeline and shape used as a destination in it: the transitions whose `dest_shape_id` is that shape (a group move). Spec shapes have no time; the track shows the moves into them                                                                             |
| Shape track `activitySpans`                  | active where at least one member's winning span is in those transitions; inactive where all are stolen (provisional, U-Q4)                                                                                                                                                 |
| `TimelineRangeChange {timelineId, range}`    | moves the whole spec timeline. Clips from the same timeline move together, so the UI highlights linked clips                                                                                                                                                               |
| `TimelineCreateTrackRequest {target, range}` | one edit: a new timeline over the range with one transition. For a marcher, a shapeless one-slot `direct` transition whose destination starts at the marcher's position at the range start; for a shape, a transition into it with the selected marchers assigned to slots |

## What the timeline doesn't show

These belong in the inspector (P8.5), not the timeline:

- path style, bulge, waypoints, destination shape, `slot_count`, `order_mode`
  and slot casting;
- the layer of each assignment (spec Q-8 stays open for anything richer);
- diagnostics (§8.9 requires them). The timeline adds a warning badge on any
  clip whose range has a diagnostic; the inspector lists them.

## Porting notes

- The components depend on 0.2's frame-clock store
  (`apps/desktop/src/services/clock/frame-clock.ts`), React, a 2D canvas for
  the grid and waveform, `clsx`, `@phosphor-icons/react` and Tailwind tokens.
  The frame clock comes over in Phase 5 (P5.9).
- The waveform comes from a context that only Storybook sets today; wire it to
  the audio player.
- `legs` keep their `move`/`hold` texture but aren't drawn.
- Not in the reference and not needed for the first port: clip edge resizing
  (maps to R-E1 later), wheel zoom and multi-select.

## Open UI questions

- **U-Q1:** which tracks show by default. A 250-marcher show gives hundreds of
  marcher tracks; candidates are shape tracks plus individually moved marchers,
  or only the selection.
- **U-Q2:** what resizing a clip edge means: an R-E1 range edit on the
  timeline's transitions, or on one assignment.
- **U-Q3:** how layers show on the timeline, if at all (spec Q-8).
- **U-Q4:** the shape track's activity rule above is provisional.
