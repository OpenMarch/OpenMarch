# Pre-commit Hook Troubleshooting

If formatting issues are getting through to CI despite lint-staged being configured:

1. **Check if pre-commit hook is executable:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .husky/pre-commit
   ```

2. **If not executable (`-rw-r--r--` instead of `-rwxr-xr-x`):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
   ```

3. **Reinstall husky hooks:**
   ```bash
   pnpm exec husky
   ```

The hook is tracked as executable in git (100755), but local filesystems can sometimes strip the permission.
