## 1. INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy (the “**Policy**”) explains how OpenMarch LLC (“**OpenMarch**”, “**we**”, “**our**”) collects, uses, and discloses personal information through its website, desktop application (the “**Desktop App**”), and mobile application (the “**Mobile App**”, and collectively with the website and Desktop App, the “**Services**”).

## 2. INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW WE USE IT

As explained further in this section, you will have the opportunity to provide us with certain personal information. In addition, we may collect certain personal information automatically through your use of the Services. The rest of this section provides a more detailed explanation of the personal information we collect and how we use that personal information.

1. **Account Creation**. If you register for an administrator account with the Services, you will need to provide your name and email address. You will also have the opportunity to provide a photo of yourself. As part of the account creation process, you may choose to provide the foregoing information using certain third-party accounts, like Google and Apple. OpenMarch uses this information to manage your account and communicate with you about your use of the Services.

2. **Payment Processing**. If you are an administrator, you can purchase access to the Mobile App for performers in your ensemble and other authorized users. Your payment information will be processed by our third-party payment processor. We will not have access to your payment information.

3. **Performers**. Performers are not asked to submit any personal information. Each performer can sign into the Mobile App by using a code and password provided by an administrator for their ensemble. As part of this authentication process, the performer will be asked to designate their instrument and position within their ensemble. Although performers do not submit any personal information, please see Section 2.4 below regarding certain information that we may automatically collect in order to authenticate performers and manage sessions on the Mobile App.

4. **Automatically Collected Information**. Whenever you interact with the Services, we automatically receive and record your IP address and device ID. We collect your IP address and device ID for user authentication and to ensure the security of the Services. We also identify the operating system for your device, so that we can ensure compatibility with the Services. Finally, we use cookies on the website for authentication and session management. “Cookies” are small text files that we transfer to your browser.

5. **Desktop Analytics**. If you are an administrator and are using the Desktop App, you may opt into our collection of analytics information regarding your use of the Desktop App. If you do opt in, we will track activity such as the features on the Desktop App that you use and load times within the Desktop App.

## 3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

We may disclose your personal information to the categories of third parties identified in this section.

1. **Personnel and Third Party Service Providers**. We employ personnel and engage other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your personal information with them to provide products or services to you. For example, we use a third party payment processor to process payments on our behalf. In addition, for those administrators who opt into our analytics tracking for the Desktop App, we rely on a third party vendor to process the analytics data.

2. **Business Transfers**. If we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, personal information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

3. **Legal Compliance**. We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with governmental requests, law enforcement or court orders, or enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements.

## 4. SECURITY

We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. In addition, we enter into contracts with all of our third party service providers that require reasonable precautions be taken against unauthorized uses of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant that these precautions will always be successful or that your personal information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

## 5. MODIFICATION, DELETION & RETENTION OF INFORMATION

If you have an administrator account, you can access, modify, and delete your personal information through your account settings in the Desktop App or Mobile App or by emailing us at [support@openmarch.com](mailto:support@openmarch.com]). If you are a performer and you would like us to clear any record of your IP address or device ID, you can email us at [support@openmarch.com](mailto:support@openmarch.com]).

Subject to your right to request deletion of your personal information, we will retain your personal information as long as needed for your use of the Services.

## 6. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS

We will honor your exercise of your rights with respect to your personal information in accordance with Section 5\. Apart from those rights, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.
