Use Vitest to write all unit tests.

Tests should be placed in a **test** folder within the same directory of the file being tested.

Never use mocks for packages or database operations.
Everything should be able to be tested with the real functionality.
If you run into trouble getting a module to import correctly, please ask for assistance.
The only exception to this is mocking React context providers when trying to render components that rely on the hooks.
