Learn about the codebase here.

We'd recommend looking at all of our [issues](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/issues) and picking some you'd like to work on. The ones with `good first issue` and `help wanted` tags are good for getting started.

Feel free to ask questions on the Discord if you have problems with anything.

## Monorepo

### Structure

This is the structure of our monorepo.

```
.
├── apps/
│   ├── desktop - The main desktop app
│   └── website - Our website (and the one you're looking at right now)
├── packages/
│   ├── core - Utilities and tools for the codebase
│   ├── ui - Our design system & playground
│   └── * - A handful of other packages we use for various utilities
└── package.json
```

### Tasks

Tasks are our main commands in the codebase.

```bash
# Install packages
pnpm install

# Prepare electron app (this only needs to be run after test:prepare)
pnpm desktop app:prepare
# Run the desktop app dev server
pnpm desktop dev

# Run the website's astro dev server
pnpm site dev

# Run the design system playground
pnpm ui dev
```

#### Utilities

```bash
# Fix
pnpm fix
# or individually:
pnpm format
pnpm lint
pnpm spellcheck

# can also run tasks in specific packages
pnpm desktop lint
```

#### Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests in the monorepo
pnpm test

# Test a specific file in the desktop app
cd apps/desktop
pnpm exec vitest path/to/the/file.test.ts

# Run end-to-end tests in the desktop app
cd apps/desktop
pnpm run e2e

# Generate more e2e test code
# See apps/desktop/e2e/README.md for more information
cd apps/desktop
pnpm run e2e:codegen
```
