# Timeline Worker Procedure

The procedure an agent (or a person) follows to take one timeline work package
from `open` to `in-review`. It is tool-agnostic. The Claude Code skill
`/timeline-work` and the `timeline-worker` agent both just run this file.

The design goal is that **any session can stop at any moment**, whether from a
usage limit, a crash or a closed laptop, and a later session can continue from
what's on the remote. Checkpoint often, and keep nothing important only in your
head.

Input: an optional work package ID such as `P1.2`. Without one, pick the next
available package (step 2).

## 1. Orient

1. Fetch: `git fetch <remote>`. The remote is `origin` unless
   `TIMELINE_REMOTE` says otherwise. The coordination branch is named in
   [README.md](README.md) and defaults to `timeline-try-2` in
   `scripts/timeline/coord.sh`.
2. Read [README.md](README.md) (the protocol), then, if you haven't in this
   session, [implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md).
3. Read the **coordination branch's** copy of the phase file, not a possibly
   stale local one:
   `git show <remote>/<coord-branch>:docs/timeline/phases/<file>.md`.
4. Read that phase's **Handoff notes** and its last three **Progress log**
   entries. If the last entry for your package has a `Resume from:` line, you
   are resuming, and that line is where you start.

## 2. Choose

- **With an ID:** use it. Stop if it's owned by someone else and isn't stale
  (see the README), or if its `Owner` is `human`. For a `human` package you may
  prepare material, but don't close it.
- **Without an ID:** list packages from the coordination branch, and take the
  first one that is `open` or stale, isn't `human`, and whose `Depends on`
  packages (and phase dependencies) are `done` or, for code that builds on
  them, at least merged. Prefer lower phases, then lower IDs.
- **Resuming your own package** (status `claimed` or `in-progress` and the log
  names you or a session running this procedure): continue it without
  re-claiming.
- If nothing is available, finish with `TIMELINE-STATUS: none` (step 7).

## 3. Claim

Edit coordination files only through the helper, which works in a separate
checkout of the coordination branch and retries on push races:

```sh
dir=$(scripts/timeline/coord.sh start)   # prints the coordination checkout path
# edit "$dir/docs/timeline/phases/<file>.md": Owner, Status: claimed
scripts/timeline/coord.sh commit "docs(timeline): claim P1.2"
```

Owner format: `<agent-or-person> (<code-branch>)`. If the phase front matter is
`not-started`, set it to `in-progress` and set its `owner` to you in the same
commit. If the push loses a race to another claim on the same package, re-read
the file; if they got it first, go back to step 2.

## 4. Set up the code branch

- Branch name: `timeline/p<phase>-<short-name>`, such as
  `timeline/p1-geometry`. Several packages in one phase may share a branch when
  one owner does them in sequence.
- Base it on `<remote>/<coord-branch>` until Phase 0 merges, then on
  `<remote>/main`.
- If the branch already exists on the remote (you're resuming), check it out
  instead of creating it.
- Work in a separate git work tree unless your session already runs in one
  (for example `claude --worktree`, or an agent with worktree isolation).
- In a fresh work tree, run `pnpm install` before building or testing.

## 5. Work in small steps, with checkpoints

Break the package into steps that each end in a passing state, such as "port
`geom.ts` and its golden tests". After **every** step, and before starting
anything long:

1. Commit to the code branch and push it. Use `wip:` commits if the step isn't
   reviewable yet; they get squashed at merge.
2. Append a log entry through `coord.sh`, in the README's format, and add one
   more line:
   `- **Resume from:** <the exact next step, the files involved, and any command to re-run first>`.
3. Keep your package's `- Status:` at `in-progress`.

If you sense the session ending (context is being compacted, a usage warning,
or you're about to wait on something slow), checkpoint first.

Throughout:

- Follow the root `AGENTS.md`, the nearest package `AGENTS.md`, and
  `docs/conventions/` for the area you're changing.
- The spec (`docs/timeline/spec.md`) wins on the model. The reference code is in
  `docs/timeline/ref/`.
- Don't edit other packages' lines or other phases' work packages. Use a
  `Cross-phase note from P<n>` log entry in the other phase's file instead.
- A decision that changes a `C-n` conflict, the schema, a file format, IPC or a
  public API stops the work: log it as a blocker for a person.

## 6. Finish

1. Run every exit-gate check that your package covers, plus the checks in
   `docs/conventions/verification.md` for the changed area.
2. Squash or tidy `wip:` commits. Confirm
   `git log <base>..HEAD --format=%B` has no AI attribution or co-author lines
   (root `AGENTS.md`).
3. Push, and open a PR against the base branch with `gh pr create`. Its body
   names the work package IDs and the checks you ran, with results.
4. Through `coord.sh`: set `- Status: in-review` and `- PR: <url>`, tick only
   the exit-gate items you actually ran, and append a final log entry.
5. If you're blocked instead: set `- Status: blocked`, and log exactly what is
   needed and from whom.

## 7. Report

End your final message with exactly one line, which scripts can match:

```text
TIMELINE-STATUS: <P-id> <in-review|blocked|in-progress>
```

or `TIMELINE-STATUS: none` when nothing was available.
