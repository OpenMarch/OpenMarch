 *
 * - on the shape (a handle, the rotate knob, just outside a corner, the center dot, its body):
 *   that gesture, the same as on a selected placed shape (`frame/gestures.ts`);
 * - anywhere else: draw a new shape, which replaces the open one.
 *
 * Releasing ends the gesture as one undo step. Who goes where is held during every gesture. Only
 * a fresh draw, a change in how many spots there are across or deep, or Recalculate (#429) works
 * it out again, by least travel (or, on a Line, the order picked: #528): stretching, moving, turning and flipping keep each marcher on
 * their own spot, so a turned or flipped form is the same form (owner, 2026-10-16).
