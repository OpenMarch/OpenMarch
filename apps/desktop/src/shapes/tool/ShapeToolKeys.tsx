 * The keys the open shape tool takes over. Mounted only while it's open, after the editor's own
 * handlers, so these sit on top of them and the keys go back once the tool closes.
 *
 * - Escape: a gesture goes back to where it started; a selected point (#557) is cleared;
 *   otherwise the tool closes, placing nothing.
 * - Enter while clicking a line's points finishes the line (#524); otherwise it's Place.
 *   That is an undo step: undo right after it brings the shape back ({@link DiscardedShapeKeys}).
 * - Backspace or Delete while clicking a line's points takes the last one back, as a right-click
 *   does (owner, option A on #522), and so does undo; otherwise undo and redo step through the
 *   shape's own edits. The show is untouched until Place.
 * - The nudge keys move the whole shape, as one undo step each (08), not the marchers under it.
