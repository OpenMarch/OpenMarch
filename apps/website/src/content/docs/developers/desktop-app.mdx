## Database issues

If you're having issues with the desktop app's database when running the dev server or installing, try following [these steps](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas?tab=readme-ov-file#compiling) and doing a clean `pnpm install`.

## Structure

Simplified directory structure:

- `/electron` - The "main" process, the backend of the app, with database and system functionality
  - /database
  - /main
  - /preload - Preload script for IPC
- `/src` - the "renderer" process, this is our react frontend.
  - `/components` - In here you find all the components of OpenMarch, the sidebars, titlebar, dialogs, UI component primitives. All of them are in their subfolder.
  - `/context` - React Context for the app of some sort of state/value
  - `/global` - Classes, objects and functions for various items in the app, such as Page, Marcher, MarcherShape, etc.
  - `/stores` - Global stores for certain items and actions, such as the list of Pages and Marchers
  - `App.tsx` - the main app file

Most of the directories like `stores`, `context`, and `database` also have a `__test__` directory which are used for testing.

## Running Tests

Since Electron must rebuild `better-sqlite3` (the package used to interact with the database), we must follow a few steps when transitioning between running automated tests and running the app.

### Prepare for testing

These steps only apply for tests involving database interactions.
You don't need to rebuild any packages if you're only testing frontend components.
If you don't, though, the entire test suite will not pass.

> For frontend specific tests, ignore the steps below and just run `npm run test`.
>
> Using the `Vitest` extension in VSCode is also handy.

<Steps>

1. Close the app if it's running
1. Rebuild the `better-sqlite3` package

   ```bash
   npm run test:prepare
   ```

   - This will rebuild `better-sqlite3` to run on the same version of Node.js that the rest of the packages are on

1. If the tests didn't start, run them again

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

1. You can see other test scripts in the `package.json`

</Steps>

### Running the app after testing

Since we rebuilt `better-sqlite3` with `npm`, we must rebuild it so that it can run in our Electron main process.

> Also do this if you ever see this error. It indicates that `better-sqlite3` has not been rebuilt with the same version of Node.js as the Electron main process:
>
> ```
> Failed to connect to database:
> PLEASE RUN 'node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3' to resolve this
> ```

<Steps>

1. Stop any tests if they are running.
1. Rebuild `better-sqlite3` for Electron

   ```bash
   npm run app:prepare
   ```

   - This will rebuild `better-sqlite3` to run on the same version of Node.js that the Electron main process is on

1. The app should launch on its own, but if it doesn't you can run `npm run dev` to launch it.
