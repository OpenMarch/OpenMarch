# Phase 2: Editor

Build the editor module (plain TypeScript, no React, no three.js) and its
gestures on the new field. Every rule here is in the
[interaction rules table](../implementation-plan.md#interaction-rules).

## Tickets

- **#193 Editor core: click selection.** The editor owns the one selection,
  shared with the app, and hit testing in field coordinates. Click,
  Shift+click, click on empty field, Ctrl/Cmd+A and the hover cursor.
  Selection rings on marchers, and the selection box in the SVG overlay.
- **#194 Navigation.** Wheel zoom at the cursor, trackpad pan, pinch, right-
  and middle-drag pan, limits, zoom controls, fit and touch. Alt no longer
  pans.
- **#195 Marquee and lasso.** Marquee on drag, lasso on double-click-and-drag,
  Shift adds. The lasso closes only within 50 screen px of its start, with
  the green cue.
- **#196 Move and drop.** Drag one marcher or the selection. Under 4 screen
  px is a click. Drops go through the existing drop-to-timeline planner,
  unchanged. Pending positions, snap-back, one undo step, the "move them
  too" toast. Nudges and field actions verified unchanged.
- **#197 Snapping, precision and locks.** Single-marcher vs group snapping,
  Shift, Alt at ¼ speed, Lock X/Y on marchers only.
- **#198 Group scale and rotate handles.** Corner, middle and rotate handles
  in the overlay, with their Shift and Alt rules, no flipping, refit after
  each transform. The inspector's rotation input uses the same transform.

## Order

#193 and #194 start after #192. #195 and #196 follow #193. Then #197, then
#198. #193 → #196 → #197 → #198 is on the critical path.

## Exit gate

- Editor unit tests cover gesture rules, snapping, hit testing and transform
  math.
- Each ticket's scenarios pass on Fabric (with only the rules-table changes
  edited in) and on the new field.

## Handoff notes

Append notes the next tickets need: file locations, seams, surprises.
