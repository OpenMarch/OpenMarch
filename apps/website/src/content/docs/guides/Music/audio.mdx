## Apply offsets to your audio file

To have precise tempo syncing, you can apply either a positive or negative offset to your audio file.
This will pad or trim the audio file respectively.

<Steps>

1. Open the `Music` tab
1. Enter your offset (either positive or negative) in the `Audio Offset` input
1. Press `Enter` or click outside the input to apply the offset
1. The audio file will be padded or trimmed accordingly
