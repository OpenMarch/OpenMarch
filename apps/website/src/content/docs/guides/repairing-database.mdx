If you're seeing errors like "Error updating {'{'}something{'}'}" in OpenMarch, or you see an error message in the console like:

```
Error updating pages Error: Group before and after do not match. Expected {number} but got {number - 1}.
The expected group is greater, meaning that the function didn't perform any database actions on tables that are tracked by undo/redo history triggers
```

This indicates your database file may have become corrupted or out of sync. OpenMarch includes a database repair tool that can fix these issues.

## When to use database repair

Use the repair tool if you encounter:

- **Error messages** like "Error updating pages", "Error updating beats", or similar errors when trying to modify your drill
- **Console errors** about group mismatches between before and after states in undo/redo history
- **General database corruption** or unexpected behavior that prevents you from editing your file

## How to repair your database

<Steps>

1. **Open Settings** - Click on the `File` menu in the top bar, then select `Settings`

2. **Navigate to the repair section** - In the settings panel, find the "Repair DOTS file" button

3. **Start the repair** - Click the "Repair DOTS file" button. A confirmation dialog will appear explaining that:
   - A new database file will be created with "- FIXED" appended to the filename
   - All your data will be copied to the new file with the latest schema
   - Undo/redo history will not be copied

4. **Confirm the repair** - Click "Repair" in the confirmation dialog. The repair process may take a moment depending on the size of your file

5. **Open the repaired file** - Once the repair completes, OpenMarch will automatically reload and open the repaired file (the one with "- FIXED" in the name). Your original file remains unchanged as a backup

</Steps>

## What gets copied

The repair process copies all your drill data:

- ✅ Marchers and sections
- ✅ Pages and beats
- ✅ All coordinate data
- ✅ Field properties
- ✅ Workspace settings
- ❌ Undo/redo history (this is reset)

## Your original file is safe

The repair tool creates a **new file** with "- FIXED" added to the filename. Your original `.dots` file is never modified, so you can always go back to it if needed.

For example, if your file is named `my-show.dots`, the repaired file will be named `my-show - FIXED.dots`.
